<p>John was one of the Micrphone Controllers in Lacombe Junior High's Talent Show. He took it upon himself to reach out to others to try and get them to join the Talent show. While he still gets nervous talking to people in public, he showcased himself as being able to  talk to large audience when it matters the most. This Talent show was organized by the school's leadership team that he was apart of.

<p>It is an honour and a priviledge to have receieved this award. A very symbolic and day to day representation on who I strive to be, knowing that one persons friendly presence can change anothers is one I try to live by. Ryan from the stories I've been told is someone that embodies the meaning of great friendship. Someone who was well known for good things, not one who was egotistical and immature. Something that I will keep in mind as I look forward to the next chapters in my life..

    The talent show was organized by the leadership team he was in. In order to make the talent show work, everyone in the group had a specific role to follow. One that demonstrated the team's ability to work in a collective manner and do this where certain individuals such as John were asked to take the lead.

<p>
    Lacombe Junior High hosted a food drive that I was lucky enough to be a part of. In this food drive, we donated the food that we gained from our fellow classmates to the local food shelter service. One of the many memories I cherished due to helping out others when I can at a young age, and stepping up in order to do my best for things to succeed.
